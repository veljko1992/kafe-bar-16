# Kafe-Bar-16

This is a team project of Classroom 43 Krojac school where we should best present one coffee shop in Belgrade and fulfill the client's expectations.

The professor was the project leader and he defined the roles in the project.
We used PHP so that we could split the project into the whole so everyone could do their job and create a template.
We used Bootstrap to make the site responsive.
We used some Jquery library to make a gallery and some other interesting things to improve the project.

It was very nice to work on the team, we learned a lot of new things about work and better met each other.
